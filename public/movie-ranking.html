<h3>The Gladiator</h3>

<p>This is my favourite movie. I liked how scenes are done.<br/>
Russel Crew was extraordinary in this role.</p>

<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<p>This movie is one of the best Tom Cruise movies.<br/>
It's a very emmotional movie.</p>

<h3>Mission impossible</h3>
<p>what a splendid serie of action movies.</p>
